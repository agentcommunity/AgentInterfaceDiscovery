# Schema Bump Plan (aid 1 â†’ aid 1 (updated! ))

src/schemas.ts IS NOT CHANGABLE!! THIS CAN NOT BE CHANGED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH and it is in line with the specification (src/specifiction.md)


## 1. Schema Changes Overview


### 1.1 Core Changes
- **Implementation Object**
  - `name`: Now REQUIRED (machine identifier, unique within manifest)
  - `title`: Now REQUIRED (human-readable display string)
  - `mcpVersion`: New OPTIONAL field (e.g., "2025-06-18")
  - `capabilities`: New OPTIONAL object (e.g., `{ structuredOutput: {}, resourceLinks: {} }`)

- **Authentication Object**
  - OAuth changes:
    - REMOVED: Static endpoints (`authorizationEndpoint`, etc.)
    - ADDED: `dynamicClientRegistration` boolean flag
  - Enhanced mTLS support via `certificate` object

### 1.2 Impact Surface
1. **Core Package**
   - `schemas.ts` (primary schema definitions)
   - `types.ts` (TypeScript type definitions)
   - Generated JSON Schema
   - Tests and snapshots

2. **Conformance Package**
   - All validators
   - Test fixtures (valid/invalid)
   - Snapshot tests

3. **Web UI**
   - Form components
   - Validation logic
   - Example manifests

reminder. src/schemas.ts can't be changed. It is the single source of truth! 

## Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE

Phase 1, the update of the `@aid/core` package, is complete. The following tasks were performed to align the core library with the new schema defined in `src/schemas.ts`:

*   **Verified Schema Updates**: Confirmed that `packages/core/src/schemas.ts` reflects the new specification, including the addition of `title`, `mcpVersion`, and `capabilities` to implementations, the renaming of `configuration` to `requiredConfig`, and the overhaul of the OAuth configuration.

*   **Updated `generator.ts`**: The demo configuration object was updated to include the new mandatory `title` field and use a machine-friendly `name`, resolving type errors.

*   **Updated `resolver.ts`**: The `getImplementations` function was modified to correctly map the new `title` field to the `ActionableImplementation`'s `name` property. It was also updated to use `requiredConfig` instead of the old `configuration` field.

*   **Updated `common.ts`**: The `isComplex` logic within the `buildTxtRecord` function was updated to check for `requiredConfig`, ensuring DNS records are generated correctly based on the new schema.

*   **Regenerated JSON Schema**: Executed the `schema:generate` script to produce an updated `schema/v1/aid.schema.json` that is consistent with the new Zod definitions.

*   **Verified Type Definitions**: The main `types.ts` file, which uses `z.infer`, automatically reflects the schema changes. No manual changes were needed.

The `@aid/core` package is now internally consistent with the latest schema. The next step is to address Phase 2: Conformance Updates.

## Phase 2 Status: COMPLETE

Phase 2, the update of the `@aid/conformance` package, is complete. This phase ensured that our validation logic correctly and strictly enforces the new schema rules.

*   **Corrected Core Schema Strictness**: Identified and fixed a critical bug in `packages/core/src/schemas.ts` where Zod's `.strict()` was not being applied to nested objects. I applied `.strict()` to `oAuthDetailsSchema`, `baseImplementationSchema`, and `aidGeneratorConfigSchema` to ensure the entire manifest is validated against unrecognized keys. This was a necessary bug fix to enforce the removal of legacy OAuth fields.

*   **Updated All Valid Test Fixtures**: Systematically updated all JSON fixtures in `packages/conformance/tests/fixtures/valid/` to be compliant with the new schema. This involved:
    *   Changing `serviceName` to `name` and removing the `domain` key to reflect the manifest structure.
    *   Adding the mandatory `title` field to all implementations.
    *   Updating implementation `name` fields to be machine-friendly identifiers.
    *   Renaming the `configuration` key to `requiredConfig` and updating variable substitutions.
    *   Overhauling the `auth0.json` fixture to use the new `dynamicClientRegistration` model for OAuth.

*   **Added New Conformance Tests**: Expanded the test suite in `conformance.test.ts` to cover new schema rules:
    *   Added a test to ensure a manifest containing legacy, static OAuth endpoints is correctly identified as **invalid**.
    *   Added a test to ensure a manifest using the new `mcpVersion` and `capabilities` fields is correctly identified as **valid**.

*   **Updated Snapshots & Verified All Tests Pass**: After correcting the fixtures and test logic, all tests in the conformance suite, including snapshots and new assertions, are passing.

The `@aid/conformance` package now robustly validates the updated AID manifest schema. The next step is to adapt the Web UI in Phase 3.

## Phase 3 Status: COMPLETE

Phase 3, the adaptation of the Web UI in `@aid/web`, is complete. The generator form now fully supports the new schema, and the sample manifests have been updated.

*   **Updated All Sample Manifests**: All files in `packages/web/aid-generator/public/samples/` were updated to the latest `AidGeneratorConfig` schema, ensuring the examples presented to the user are valid and up-to-date.

*   **Updated Basic Info Form**: The form at `components/form-sections/implementation-parts/basic-info-section.tsx` was overhauled:
    *   The `name` field was repurposed to be a machine-friendly ID.
    *   A new, human-readable `title` field was added.
    *   New optional fields for `mcpVersion` and the `capabilities` hints (`structuredOutput`, `resourceLinks`) were added.

*   **Updated Configuration Form**: The component at `components/form-sections/implementation-parts/config-variables-section.tsx` was updated to use `requiredConfig` instead of the old `configuration` key, aligning the form state with the schema.

*   **Updated Authentication Form**: The `components/form-sections/implementation-parts/authentication-section.tsx` was significantly changed to support the new OAuth flow:
    *   Removed UI for the deprecated static OAuth endpoints (`tokenEndpoint`, `deviceAuthorizationEndpoint`, etc.).
    *   Added a new checkbox for the `dynamicClientRegistration` boolean.
    *   Simplified the `scopes` input to a single textarea for comma-separated values.

The Web UI is now fully aligned with the new schema. The final phase is deployment and documentation.

## Phase 4: Release & Docs

*   **Goal**: Tag and release new versions of packages, and update documentation.
*   **Branch**: `release/schema-bump-2025-06`
*   **Tasks**:
    *   `lerna version` (or manual `package.json` bumps) for `@aid/core`, `@aid/conformance`.
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` files.
    *   Update official specification document.
    *   Merge to `main`.
    *   `git tag vX.Y.Z` and push.
    *   Coordinate with consumers on upgrade path.

## Phase 5: Conformance CLI

*   **Goal**: Add a `--migrate` flag to the conformance CLI.
*   **Branch**: `feat/cli-migration`
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Add `yargs` command for migration.
    *   Implement migration logic in `@aid/core` or `@aid/conformance` to convert old manifests to new ones.
        *   `name` -> `title`
        *   Generate new `name` (e.g., from `title` or `uri`)
        *   `configuration` -> `requiredConfig`
        *   OAuth: remove static fields, add `dynamicClientRegistration: true` if old fields were present.
    *   Add tests for the migration logic.

## Phase 6: Release & Monitoring

*   **Goal**: Release the updated CLI and monitor for issues.
*   **Branch**: `release/cli-migration`
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Release new CLI version.
    *   Announce the new feature.
    *   Monitor for bug reports or feedback.
