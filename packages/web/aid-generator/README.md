# AID Generator Web UI

A Next.js web application for generating and validating Agent Interface Discovery (AID) manifests in real-time. This tool provides an intuitive, responsive, form-based interface for creating AID configurations that comply with the official specification.

This web UI is part of a larger monorepo. For details on the core library and the AID specification itself, please see the [main project README.md](../../../README.md).

## üéØ Key Features

-   **Live Generation & Validation**: Instantly see the generated `aid.json` manifest and DNS TXT record as you type. Get immediate, clear feedback on validation errors.
-   **Fully Responsive Design**: A two-column layout for desktop provides a comprehensive view, which seamlessly transitions to a mobile-friendly single-column layout.
-   **Centralized, Reactive State**: Built on a modern stack using React Hook Form and Context for robust and predictable state management.
-   **Browser-Native Core Logic**: Utilizes a browser-safe version of the `@aid/core` library, ensuring 100% spec compliance between the UI and the canonical implementation.
-   **Full Spec Support**: All authentication schemes and implementation types (remote, local) are supported.
-   **Sample Templates**: Load pre-built examples for common use cases like Auth0, Supabase, and multi-implementation profiles.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture: A Centralized & Reactive Form

The generator was refactored to address a core architectural challenge: the original implementation had a data model mismatch where the UI was attempting to load final, generated manifests as if they were pre-generation configuration files.

The new architecture is built around a **single source of truth for form state**, managed by `react-hook-form` and provided to all components via a React Context (`GeneratorFormProvider`). This eliminates prop-drilling and ensures all components are perfectly synchronized.

### Data Flow

This diagram illustrates how data moves from the raw example files to the reactive UI:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph "Local Development Setup"
        A["Developer edits raw config<br/>(e.g., /examples/simple.json)"] --> B{"pnpm build:examples"};
        B --> C["Script copies raw config to<br/>/web/public/samples/"];
    end

    subgraph "Web UI: Generator"
        D["SampleLoader Dropdown"] -->|loads config into| E["<b>GeneratorFormProvider</b><br/>(Central React Hook Form state)"];
        C -->|is loaded by| D;
        E <--> F["Form Components<br/>(e.g., ServiceSection, etc.)"];
        G["OutputPanel Component"] -- "watches form state" --> E;
        G -- "calls" --> H["@aid/core/browser<br/>(buildManifest, buildTxtRecord)"];
        G --> I["Live Manifest Output"];
        G --> J["Live DNS Record Output"];
        G --> K["Live Validation Errors"];
    end

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    classDef default fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
```

## üîß Core Components

### 1. `GeneratorFormProvider`
The heart of the application. It initializes `react-hook-form` and wraps the entire form, providing global state access to every component. This centralization is key to the app's stability and scalability.

### 2. `@aid/core/browser`
The engine for all generation logic. The UI exclusively imports from the `/browser` entry point of the core library. This is critical because it guarantees that only browser-safe code (without Node.js dependencies like `fs`) is bundled, preventing client-side errors.

### 3. `OutputPanel.tsx`
This component provides the real-time feedback loop. It was refactored to fix a critical "maximum update depth exceeded" error. It now uses `react-hook-form`'s subscription-based `watch` method inside a single `useEffect` hook. This efficient approach ensures the component only re-renders when necessary, providing instant output without causing infinite loops.

## üöÄ Development

### Setup

```bash
# From the root of the monorepo
pnpm install
pnpm -F aid-generator dev
```

### Development Workflow

1.  **Type & Logic Changes**: All changes to the data model or generation logic **must** be made in the `@aid/core` package first.
2.  **Build Core**: After changing `@aid/core`, run `pnpm build` from the root to compile the changes and make them available to the web UI.
3.  **UI Development**: The web UI in `packages/web/aid-generator` will automatically pick up the updated types and functions. Adjust form fields and components as needed.
