# AID Generator Refactoring (REWIRE)

This document outlines the significant refactoring effort to align the `web` UI with the `core` package, establishing a single source of truth for the AID data model and generation logic.

## 1. Goal

The primary goal was to eliminate code duplication and prevent future divergence between the canonical `core` logic and the `web` UI implementation. By making the `core` package a true dependency, we ensure that the web application is always built on the spec-compliant, canonical foundation.

## 2. Summary of Changes

### a. Monorepo & Package Architecture
- **`@aid/core` Package:** A `package.json` was created for the `core` library, officially defining it as the `@aid/core` package. Its `tsconfig.json` was updated to output a compiled `dist` directory.
- **Workspace Link:** The `pnpm-workspace.yaml` was corrected, and `@aid/core` was added as a direct workspace dependency to the `aid-generator` web application.

### b. Type Centralization
- **Deleted `web/lib/types.ts`:** The duplicated type definitions in the web app were removed entirely.
- **Centralized Imports:** All components and utility files in the web app (`page.tsx`, `config-form.tsx`, `validation.ts`, etc.) were updated to import their types directly from `@aid/core`.

### c. Generator Logic Alignment
- **Simplified Web Generator:** The `web/lib/generator.ts` was simplified. The complex key-reordering logic was removed, as it's not required by the JSON spec and adds fragility. The web generator is now a lightweight, client-safe version used for live UI previews.
- **Canonical API Generator:** The API endpoint at `app/api/generate/route.ts` was refactored to import and use the `buildManifest` and `buildTxtRecord` functions directly from the `@aid/core` package, ensuring all final outputs are generated by the canonical logic.

### d. Schema & Validation Hardening
- **Aligned Zod Schemas:** The Zod validation schemas in `web/lib/schemas.ts` were updated to strictly match the `core` types. This involved making previously optional fields (like `description` in `AuthConfig` and `tokenEndpoint` in `OAuthAuth`) required, which resolved critical type mismatches between the form validation and the final data model.
- **Version Compatibility:** Updated Zod and @hookform/resolvers to compatible versions (zod@3.22.4 and @hookform/resolvers@3.3.4) to resolve type conflicts and ensure proper form validation.

### e. Full Spec-Compliance and UI Hardening
Following the initial refactoring, a second phase of work was undertaken to make the generator fully compliant with the AID v1 specification.

- **Hardened Core Library:** The `@aid/core` types were updated to precisely match the spec (e.g., `revocationUrl` -> `revocationURL`, stricter OAuth types, added `env` property). The DNS TXT record generator was also fixed to produce a fully compliant output.
- **Centralized & Enhanced Validation:** The `web/lib/validation.ts` file was deleted, and all validation logic was consolidated into the Zod schemas in `web/lib/schemas.ts`. This included adding complex conditional validation (e.g., requiring `placement` for remote auth schemes).
- **Feature-Complete UI:** The `implementation-form.tsx` was significantly enhanced to include UI controls for all remaining spec features:
  - `status` (active/deprecated)
  - Per-implementation `revocationURL`
  - `authentication.placement` (how to apply a token)
  - `authentication.tokenUrl`
  - `authentication.credentials` (for multi-part secrets)
  - `certificate` configuration for `mTLS`
  - `requiredPaths` for local implementations
  - `platformOverrides` for OS-specific execution
- **Security Notice:** A security warning was added to the UI, which appears when a user configures a `local` implementation, advising them of client-side security responsibilities as per the spec.

### f. Browser and Node.js Code Separation
A critical architectural improvement was made to properly separate browser-safe code from Node.js-specific functionality:

- **New `common.ts` Module:** Created a new file containing only browser-safe functions:
  - Moved `buildManifest` and `buildTxtRecord` from `generator.ts`
  - These functions have no dependencies on Node.js built-ins like `fs`

- **Restructured Core Files:**
  - `generator.ts`: Now only contains Node.js specific code (file I/O operations)
  - `browser.ts`: Updated to only export from `common.ts` and `types.ts`
  - `index.ts`: Exports everything for Node.js environments
  - Removed `node.ts` as its functionality is now properly organized in other modules

- **Fixed Build Issues:**
  - Resolved the `Can't resolve 'fs'` error in Next.js builds
  - Ensured proper tree-shaking of Node.js code in browser bundles
  - Updated Zod schemas to exactly match core types
  - Fixed TypeScript errors related to OAuth type definitions

This separation ensures that browser bundles remain lean and don't include Node.js-specific code, while still maintaining full functionality in Node.js environments.

### g. Implementation Form Modularization
A significant refactoring of the implementation form was completed to improve maintainability and code organization:

- **Component Modularization:** The monolithic `implementation-form.tsx` (1300+ lines) was split into focused, single-responsibility components:
  - `BasicInfoSection`: Handles name, protocol, and status fields
  - `TagsSection`: Manages tags with add/remove functionality
  - `LocalPackageSection`: Contains package and execution configuration
  - `PlacementSection`: Handles authentication placement configuration
  - `AuthenticationSection`: Manages all authentication-related fields
  
- **Code Organization:**
  - Created new directory `form-sections/implementation-parts/` to house the modular components
  - Each component is independently maintainable and testable
  - Reduced main form complexity from 1300+ lines to about 50 lines
  - Improved code readability and maintainability

- **State Management:**
  - Each component handles its own local state
  - Form state remains centralized through react-hook-form
  - Clean props interface between components

- **Import Structure:**
  - Consolidated and organized imports
  - Removed unused dependencies
  - Fixed linter errors and type definitions

### h. Recent Improvements and Bug Fixes
- **Quote Escaping:** Fixed unescaped quotes in form descriptions and tooltips using proper HTML entities (`&quot;`)
- **Unused Code Cleanup:** Removed unused imports and functions across components:
  - Removed unused `Textarea` imports from `basic-info-section.tsx` and `config-variables-section.tsx`
  - Removed unused `handleSelectChange` function from `basic-info-section.tsx`
- **Template String Formatting:** Improved template string placeholder formatting in form fields for better readability
- **Build System:** Fixed build errors and type mismatches by:
  - Updating to compatible versions of Zod and @hookform/resolvers
  - Properly escaping all quotes in text content
  - Ensuring proper type definitions across components

This refactoring sets the foundation for future UX improvements including:
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options
- Collapsible sections for complex fields
- "Add..." button pattern for list management
- Improved form navigation and validation feedback

### i. CSS Build System Fix
A final set of fixes was required to stabilize the local development build for the web app, which was failing to apply CSS styling due to a misconfigured Tailwind CSS toolchain.

- **The Problem:** The `pnpm --filter aid-generator dev` command resulted in an unstyled page. The root cause was a missing `tailwind.config.ts` file, which triggered a cascade of secondary errors, including missing packages (`autoprefixer`, `tailwindcss-animate`) and incorrect CSS directives.
- **The Solution:** A multi-step process was undertaken to rebuild the CSS toolchain correctly:
  1.  **Recreate Config:** A new, `shadcn/ui`-compliant `tailwind.config.ts` was created.
  2.  **Install Dependencies:** The required `autoprefixer` and `tailwindcss-animate` packages were added as `devDependencies` to the web app.
  3.  **Correct Directives:** The non-standard `@import "tailwindcss";` in `globals.css` was replaced with the correct `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;` directives.
  4.  **Align Theme & Variables:** The final error (`The 'border-border' class does not exist`) was resolved by removing a conflicting experimental PostCSS plugin (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) and aligning the theme configuration. The `tailwind.config.ts` was updated to define colors using CSS variables (`oklch(var(--border) / <alpha-value>)`), and `globals.css` was updated to define those variables with only the raw color values (e.g., `--border: 0.922 0 0;`), following the standard `shadcn/ui` pattern.
This restored the build process and ensured the UI renders correctly in local development.

### j. Dynamic & Automated Sample Loading
To improve maintainability and ensure the UI always reflects the canonical set of examples, the sample loading mechanism was automated.

- **Build Script Enhancement:** The `packages/core/scripts/build-examples.ts` script was enhanced to be the single source of truth for all examples.
  - On each run, it cleans the `packages/web/aid-generator/public/samples` directory.
  - It reads the `config.json` from each subdirectory in `packages/examples`, validates it, corrects common issues (like removing invalid keys or fixing domain formats), and copies the cleaned file into the UI's sample directory.
  - It programmatically generates an `index.json` file in the samples directory, which contains a list of all available examples with user-friendly names.

- **Dynamic `SampleLoader` Component:** The `SampleLoader.tsx` component in the UI was refactored.
  - It no longer contains a hardcoded list of samples.
  - On component mount, it fetches the `index.json` file.
  - It dynamically builds the dropdown menu based on the contents of the index, ensuring that any example added to `packages/examples` automatically appears in the UI after the build script is run.

This change eliminates manual synchronization, reduces the chance of errors, and makes the example gallery easily extensible.

Excellent. This is a textbook example of a successful and well-documented refactoring effort. You have not only improved the codebase but also clearly articulated the principles behind the changes.

Let's break this down.

### Why do we need a `dist` folder?

The `dist` (distribution) folder is a standard and crucial part of modern JavaScript/TypeScript development. It separates your **source code** (the human-readable `.ts` files you write) from the **compiled code** (the machine-runnable `.js` files and `.d.ts` type definition files).

1.  **Execution:** Browsers and Node.js cannot run TypeScript directly. The code must first be compiled into JavaScript. The `dist` folder is the standard output location for this compiled JavaScript.
2.  **Type Definitions (`.d.ts`):** When you build a TypeScript project, the compiler also generates type declaration files. When another TypeScript project (like our `web` app) imports `@aid/core`, it reads these `.d.ts` files to understand the types of your functions and objects. This is what enables autocompletion and type-checking across packages without needing to read the original source code.
3.  **Cleanliness & Separation:** It keeps your project's root directory clean. You work in `src/`, and the build process handles the output. This prevents compiled artifacts from being mixed in with your source code or accidentally committed to version control.

### Why use an `index.ts` file as a public entry point?

Using a central `index.ts` file to export your package's functionality is a best practice for creating a clear and stable **Public API** for your library.

1.  **Defines a Contract:** `index.ts` acts as a gatekeeper. It explicitly defines what functions, types, and variables a consumer of your package is allowed to access. Anything not exported from `index.ts` is considered internal or private, signaling that it could change without warning.
2.  **Simplifies Imports:** It allows for much cleaner import statements. Consumers can write:
    ```typescript
    import { AidManifest, buildManifest } from '@aid/core';
    ```
    Instead of a more brittle, path-dependent import that exposes your internal folder structure:
    ```typescript
    import { AidManifest } from '@aid/core/dist/types';
    import { buildManifest } from '@aid/core/dist/generator';
    ```
3.  **Decouples from Internal Structure:** If you decide to refactor your internal files (e.g., split `generator.ts` into smaller files), you only need to update the exports in `index.ts`. The consuming applications (`web`) don't have to change their import statements at all, making your library much easier to maintain. This is a core principle of good API design.

### Final Verdict

You have successfully executed a model refactoring. The new architecture is clean, robust, and follows industry best practices for building applications with a shared core library. The documentation you've produced clearly explains both the "how" and the "why" of these changes. This is a job well done.
